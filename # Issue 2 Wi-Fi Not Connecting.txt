# Issue 2: Wi-Fi Not Connecting

## Issue Description:
A user is unable to connect to the Wi-Fi network. The connection is either not appearing or showing as "Disconnected" despite being within range.

## Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Check Wi-Fi Status**:  
   Ensure that the Wi-Fi icon on the device is turned on. If the icon shows that Wi-Fi is off, turn it on through the settings.

2. **Reboot the Device**:  
   Ask the user to restart the device, as this can resolve temporary connection issues.

3. **Forget and Reconnect to the Network**:  
   - Go to Wi-Fi settings, click on the network, and select "Forget."  
   - Reconnect by selecting the same network and entering the password.

4. **Check Router/Modem**:  
   - Confirm if other devices can connect to the network.  
   - If no devices can connect, reboot the router and check for any issues with the ISP.

5. **Update Network Drivers (if applicable)**:  
   - Check if the device has the latest network drivers. If not, update them via the deviceâ€™s settings or device manager.

6. **Check for Interference**:  
   Ensure that the user is within range of the router and there are no major obstructions (e.g., thick walls, microwaves, or other electronics) causing interference.

7. **Test Another Device**:  
   Ask the user to connect to the Wi-Fi network with another device (like a smartphone or laptop). If other devices can connect, the issue may be with the original device.

## Conclusion:
If none of these steps work, escalate to a higher support level, as the issue could be related to hardware or configuration that requires further investigation.
